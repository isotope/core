    Unlike any other Contao module, a user is not redirected to the reader page when viewing the product details. To solve the issue of nice aliases and to know the detail page of a product, we came up with a new solution.&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    The reader page (alias) will always be the same page as you selected as a category for the product. There are two options to display the details of a product:&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Option 1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Do not set a reader page in the site structure. Place the list and reader module on the same page. Tell the list module to hide if a product alias is found (there's a checkbox in the module settings). The reader will automatically be invisible if no reader is found.&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;u&gt;Advantage:&lt;/u&gt; Pretty simple to set up&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;u&gt;Disadvantage:&lt;/u&gt; The layout of reader and list will be identical, and you cannot have different article content for the two cases.&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Option 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Set a reader page for every list page (product category) in the site structure. &lt;i&gt;Be aware that the reader setting is not inherited!&lt;/i&gt; Add the reader module to this page as usual.&lt;br&gt;
    Isotope will now use this page to generate the site if a product alias is found in the URL. The alias will still be the one from the list page though.&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;u&gt;Advantage:&lt;/u&gt; You can have different page content and layout (e.g. different columns) for the reader page then the list page.&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;u&gt;Disadvantage:&lt;/u&gt; You MUST set a reader page for every list page (category) you have. The setting is NOT INHERITED.
&lt;/p&gt;</source>

        <source>&lt;p class="tl_help_table"&gt;To upload a new picture, select the file and save the product. After successfully uploading, a preview of the image is displayed and next to it you can enter its alternative text and a description. For multiple pictures, you can click on the arrows to the right and change their order, the top image is used as the main image of each product.&lt;/p&gt;</source>
